Measuring the trading patterns of Market Makers in stock market

The question I am going to explore in the final project is:
What is the decision making process for market players (Market Makers in my case) 
and how such decision could be reflected in the market.
I plan to use clustering analysis to NASDAQ trading quotes data 
to reverse-engineer the trading activities of the market makers.
I will set my unit of analysis to be the market makers, 
track the daily trading activities of each market maker,
and use a k-means clustering method to perform a unsupervised learning
to cluster these market makers into different type of players based on their activities.

The data I will be using are from NASDAQ trading quotes data. The format is shown below:

SYMBOL,DATE,TIME,BID,OFR,BIDSIZ,OFRSIZ,MODE,EX,MMID
A,20060920,8:30:01,0,0,0,0,12,D,AUTO
A,20060920,8:30:01,28,35,1,1,12,D,NAQS
A,20060920,8:30:01,0,0,0,0,12,D,BRUT
A,20060920,8:30:01,0,0,0,0,12,D,BTRD

I plan to first divide the daily traidng hours into 30-min bins (9 to 9:30, 9:30 to 10, etc))
Then I will use MMID(market maker ID) to target players and calculate 
how much percentage of daily trading volume(size) has he accomplished by the end of each bin.

The next step data would be:
MMID,bin1,bin2,bin3,bin4,bin5,bin6,bin7,bin8,bin9,bin10, ...,bin_last
BRUT,0.05,0.15,0.24,0.33,0.34,0.46,0.51,0.57,0.68,0.72, ...,1.00

Then I will use each bin as one dimension and run a K-means analysis to cluster 
all market makers into different types of player.
